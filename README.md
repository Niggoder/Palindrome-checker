# Palindrome Checker

A simple web-based program to check whether a given string is a palindrome. A **palindrome** is a word, phrase, number, or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). 🎯✨🔍

## Features
- Handles plain text inputs.
- Ignores non-alphanumeric characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation).
- Case-insensitive comparisons.
- Provides clear feedback if the input is or isn't a palindrome. ✅💡🔎

## Prerequisites
- A modern web browser. 🌐💻📱

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/palindrome-checker.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd palindrome-checker
   ``` 🎯📂🛠️

## Usage
1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Enter a string in the input field.
3. Click the "Check" button to see the result. ✨🖥️📜

### Example
Open the application and enter:
```
A man, a plan, a canal, Panama
```
Result: The input is a palindrome. 🌟📖✅

## Testing
